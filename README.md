## Question 1 - Image Pre-Processing, Dimensionality Reduction and Classification
This task is about implementation of PCA algorithm for dimension reduction and 1NN and linear SVM for classification in 4 seasons of images.

## Question 2 - Regularized Non-Negative Matrix Factorization
In this task I found the iteretive formulas in order to make the Regularized non-negative matrix factorization for a given optimization problem.
